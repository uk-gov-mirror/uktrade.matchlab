"""Base class for transformer methodologies, and the DuckDB query runner some share.

A `Transformer` is a pure function of a record step, called by a `Transform` step's
`apply()` on every collect. Both input and output must carry `id`, the grouping every
downstream model and resolver reads.

Transformers are declarative and serialisable. Their fields are the configuration a
`Transform` folds into its spec and cache key, so keep them to plain data, with no
callables, exactly as a `Deduper`'s settings are.
