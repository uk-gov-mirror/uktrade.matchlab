"""Measure one case, in a process of its own. Not meant to be run by hand.

`runner.run` spawns this with a case on stdin and reads a measurement off stdout. The
separate process is what makes peak memory mean anything — see `runner` for why — and
it also means one case cannot leave a warmed allocator, an open DuckDB connection or a
populated cache behind for the next one.

Everything here goes through matchlab's public API.
