"""Generate a warehouse of a known size and shape, and cache it on disk.

The two things a benchmark wants to vary independently are how many *entities* exist
and how many *records* describe each one. Those cost different things — entities drive
the size of every resolver output artifact, records drive how much the matchers chew
through — so conflating them into a single `n_rows` knob, as the old example benchmark
did, makes the resulting curve uninterpretable. Here they are separate arguments.

Generation is pure Polars expressions over an entity index: no Python loop, no RNG
object, no Faker. `matchlab.testkit` is the right tool when you need planted
`TrueEntity`s and a scored diff, and the wrong one here — it generates entity by entity
through Faker, which does not reach a million entities in a time anyone will wait for.
What the benchmark needs from ground truth is much weaker: a `_truth` column, so a case
can tell whether it resolved something sane before reporting how fast it did it.

Warehouses are cached under the user cache directory, keyed by the parameters that
produced them. One warehouse serves every topology at a given size, so a sweep pays
generation once, and it is built by the parent process — a child measuring peak RSS
should not be carrying the generator's allocations in its high-water mark.
