"""Drive the cases, one subprocess each, and collect what they cost.

Isolation is the whole design here, and it buys two things.

**Peak memory becomes attributable.** A high-water resident set is monotonic within a
process, so a second case measured in the first one's process inherits its peak and
reports a number that belongs to neither. One process per case means each reports only
its own.

**Cases stop contaminating each other.** A warmed allocator, a DuckDB connection left
open, a Polars thread pool already spun up, an lru_cache holding a frame — all of them
make whichever case runs second look faster than it is.

What isolation costs is interpreter startup, paid once per case. It is priced at the
start of a run and reported in the header rather than folded into any case, so nobody
has to wonder whether a small case's number is mostly Python starting up.

The warehouse is generated **here**, in the parent, and only its path is passed down.
Generating inside a measured child would put the generator's allocations into that
child's peak, and the generator is not the thing under measurement.
